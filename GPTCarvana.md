# Using GPT to answer interview questions

## Overview

This is a project used by Carvana in part of their interview process for a Predictive Modeling position. All code and quoted lines are outputs from ChatGPT with the questions asked being the "prompt" of each section.  Although the code is useless in its original output by GPT most code sections can be applied with minor editing.

[For comparison, a completed version of the project can be found here.](https://rpubs.com/uky994/578056)


## Questions 1

### Does contact rate vary across time of day and/or day of week?

### Prompt: Use pandas to convert time data into mm-dd-yyyy format, group data by days of the week, create sub groups by early morning, late morning, early afternoon, late afternoon, create new variable called contact_rate that is yes_contact/calls, then plot contact_rate by days of the week

>To convert time data into the `mm-dd-yyyy` format using pandas, you can use the `pd.to_datetime()` function. This function takes a series or dataframe of timestamps and converts them into datetime objects. You can then use the `dt.strftime()` method to extract the month, day, and year and combine them into a new format.
Here's an example of how you could do this:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data into a dataframe
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Convert the 'time' column to datetime objects
df['time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['time'])

# Extract the month, day, and year from the 'time' column
df['month'] = df['time'].dt.strftime('%m')
df['day'] = df['time'].dt.strftime('%d')
df['year'] = df['time'].dt.strftime('%Y')

# Combine the month, day, and year into a new 'date' column in the mm-dd-yyyy format
df['date'] = df['month'] + '-' + df['day'] + '-' + df['year']

# Drop the 'month', 'day', and 'year' columns
df.drop(columns=['month', 'day', 'year'], inplace=True)

```
>To group the data by days of the week, you can use the `dt.weekday_name` method to extract the name of the day of the week from the time column. You can then use the `groupby()` function to group the data by this column.

```python
# Extract the name of the day of the week from the 'time' column
df['day_of_week'] = df['time'].dt.weekday_name

# Group the data by the 'day_of_week' column
df_by_day_of_week = df.groupby('day_of_week')

```
>To create subgroups within each day of the week, you can use the `pd.cut()` function to bin the time column into intervals. For example:
```python
# Create bins for early morning (12am-9am), late morning (9am-12pm), early afternoon (12pm-3pm), and late afternoon (3pm-12am)
bins = [0, 9, 12, 15, 24]
labels = ['early morning', 'late morning', 'early afternoon', 'late afternoon']

# Bin the 'time' column using the bins and labels defined above
df['time_of_day'] = pd.cut(df['time'].dt.hour, bins=bins, labels=labels)

# Group the data by the 'day_of_week' and 'time_of_day' columns
df_by_day_of_week_and_time_of_day = df.groupby(['day_of_week', 'time_of_day'])
```
>To create a new variable called contact_rate that is yes_contact divided by calls, you can use the `assign()` method to create a new column in the dataframe.

```python
# Calculate the contact rate and add it as a new column in the dataframe
df = df.assign(contact_rate=df['yes_contact'] / df['calls'])
```
>To plot contact_rate by days of the week, you can use the plot() method on the grouped dataframe and specify the kind parameter as 'bar':
```python
# Group the data by the 'day_of_week' column
df_by_day_of_week = df.groupby('day_of_week')

# Plot the mean contact rate for each day of the week
df_by_day_of_week['contact_rate'].mean().plot(kind='bar')

```
>This will create a bar plot with the mean contact rate for each day of the week. You can customize the plot further by setting additional parameters, such as the title, x-axis label, and y-axis label.
```python
# Customize the plot
plt.title('Contact Rate by Day of Week')
plt.xlabel('Day of Week')
plt.ylabel('Contact Rate')

```

## Question 2

### Does contact rate vary by the customerâ€™s age?

### Prompt: create a new dataframe that is made up of columns AgeCategory and PhoneNumber_hashed from the users dataframe, and columns OBCallDateTime, Contacted, advocate_id, CallTimeSec, from the calls dataframe.  in the new dataframe create a new variable called contact_rate which is yes_contact/calls.  finally plot contact_rate by age

>To create a new dataframe that combines columns from the users and calls dataframes, you can use the merge() function. This function allows you to join two dataframes based on a common column or set of columns.

>For example, if the users dataframe has a column called id that corresponds to the advocate_id column in the calls dataframe, you can join the two dataframes using the following code:
```
import pandas as pd

# Load the users and calls data into dataframes
users = pd.read_csv('users.csv')
calls = pd.read_csv('calls.csv')

# Select the columns to include in the new dataframe
users_cols = ['AgeCategory', 'PhoneNumber_hashed']
calls_cols = ['OBCallDateTime', 'Contacted', 'advocate_id', 'CallTimeSec']

# Merge the dataframes on the 'advocate_id' column
df = pd.merge(users[users_cols], calls[calls_cols], on='advocate_id')

```
>This will create a new dataframe df that contains the selected columns from both the users and calls dataframes, with the rows joined based on the advocate_id column.

>To create a new variable called contact_rate that is yes_contact divided by calls, you can use the `assign()` method to create a new column in the dataframe.
```
# Calculate the contact rate and add it as a new column in the dataframe
df = df.assign(contact_rate=df['yes_contact'] / df['calls'])

```
>To plot contact_rate by age, you can use the plot() method on the dataframe and specify the x and y parameters as the AgeCategory and contact_rate columns, respectively. You can also specify the kind parameter as 'bar' to create a bar plot.
```
# Plot the mean contact rate for each age category
df.plot(x='AgeCategory', y='contact_rate', kind='bar')

# Customize the plot
plt.title('Contact Rate by Age Category')
plt.xlabel('Age Category')
plt.ylabel('Contact Rate')

```

## Question 3

###  Does the sales conversion rate differ by Income (group this into $5000 ranges)? Why might this be the case?

### Prompt: create income groups of 5000 increments from 0 to 120000, determine portion of each group resulted in a sale, and use a chi square test to determine if their is a difference between income groups

> To create income groups of 5000 increments from 0 to 120000 and determine the portion of each group that resulted in a sale, you can use the following steps:
>
>Load the data into a pandas dataframe and select the relevant columns.
>Use the pd.cut() function to bin the income column into groups of 5000 increments.
>Use the groupby() function to group the data by the income group.
>Use the mean() method to calculate the portion of each group that resulted in a sale.
>Here's an example of how you could do this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data into a dataframe and select the relevant columns
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df = df[['income', 'sale']]

# Bin the 'income' column into groups of 5000 increments
bins = range(0, 120000, 5000)
labels = ['{}-{}'.format(bins[i], bins[i+1]) for i in range(len(bins)-1)]
df['income_group'] = pd.cut(df['income'], bins=bins, labels=labels)

# Group the data by the 'income_group' column
df_by_income_group = df.groupby('income_group')

# Calculate the mean sale rate for each income group
sale_rate = df_by_income_group['sale'].mean()

print(sale_rate)

```
>This will print the mean sale rate for each income group.

>To perform a chi-square test to determine if there is a difference between income groups, you can use the scipy.stats.chi2_contingency() function. This function calculates the chi-square statistic and p-value for a contingency table, which can be used to test the independence of two categorical variables.

>Here's an example of how you could use this function to test for a difference between income groups:

```python
import scipy.stats as stats

# Create a contingency table of the sale rate by income group
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(df['income_group'], df['sale'])

# Perform the chi-square test
chi2, p, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

print('chi-square statistic:', chi2)
print('p-value:', p)

```

>This will print the chi-square statistic and p-value for the test. If the p-value is less than 0.05, it suggests that there is a significant difference between the income groups.

## Question 4

###  How does conversion rate vary by CreditScore2 (in 50-point buckets) with regard to contact status (contacted, attempted, not attempted)?

### Prompt: the variable "contact status" can be attempted, contact, or not attempted.  sales conversion rate is sales/users.  group credit score in 50 point buckets.  plot conversion rate by credit score groups between each contact status 

>To plot the sales conversion rate by credit score groups and contact status, you can use the following steps:

>Load the data into a pandas dataframe and select the relevant columns.
> -Use the pd.cut() function to bin the credit score column into groups of 50 point increments.
> -Use the groupby() function to group the data by the credit score group and contact status.
> -Use the mean() method to calculate the conversion rate for each group.
> -Use the plot() method to create a bar plot of the conversion rate by credit score group and contact status.
>Here's an example of how you could do this:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data into a dataframe and select the relevant columns
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df = df[['credit_score', 'contact_status', 'sales', 'users']]

# Bin the 'credit_score' column into groups of 50 point increments
bins = range(0, 1000, 50)
labels = ['{}-{}'.format(bins[i], bins[i+1]) for i in range(len(bins)-1)]
df['credit_score_group'] = pd.cut(df['credit_score'], bins=bins, labels=labels)

# Group the data by the 'credit_score_group' and 'contact_status' columns
df_by_credit_score_group_and_contact_status = df.groupby(['credit_score_group', 'contact_status'])

# Calculate the conversion rate for each group
conversion_rate = df_by_credit_score_group_and_contact_status['sales'].sum() / df_by_credit_score_group_and_contact_status['users'].sum()

# Plot the conversion rate by credit score group and contact status
conversion_rate.plot(kind='bar')

# Customize the plot
plt.title('Conversion Rate by Credit Score Group and Contact Status')
plt.xlabel('Credit Score Group and Contact Status')
plt.ylabel('Conversion Rate')
