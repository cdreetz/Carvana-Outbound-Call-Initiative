# GPT-Carvana-Outbound-Call-Initiative

This project was assigned by Carvana during an interview process for a Predictive Modeling Internship.

## Background: 
Carvana had performed an outbound call initiative in which they were reaching out to customers who had inquired at some point and provided their information, but did not end up purchasing.  The goal of the initiative was to convert the unsold customers into sales.  

## The goal: 
Analyze the provided data on all customers that were a part of the initiative to determine insights on who is most likely able to be converted in the future.  The customer data consisted of things like ages, incomes, credit scores, along with the time and day of the outbound calls.  

## The plan:  
Starting off with basic preprocessing, check for missing data and for outlying data.  Followed by some basic exploration and data visuals.  Plotting conversion rates across the different age groups, income groups, and credit groups.  The time portion of the data is to be seperated and conversion rate plotted over high time frame, over the days of the week, and finally over the hours of the days.  Once we have an idea of whether there is a significant difference between groups, determine which groups high the best conversion, which have the worst conversion, and create a systme that will optimize efforts of future outbound call initiatives.  

Conversion rate: # that resulted in sale / # total outbound calls
